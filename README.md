# Slip-Regime Asymptote (1/π Signature)

**ID:** `eq-paper1-slip-asymptote`  
**Tier:** derived  
**Score:** 90  
**Units:** OK  
**Theory:** PASS  

## Equation

$$
r_b=\frac{|\Delta|}{\pi}
$$

## Description

When coupling can't lock, φ̇→Δ, so parity flips at a universal rate set by detuning. With Δ=1, r_b = 1/π ≈ 0.3183. This is the falsifiable signature: any experiment measuring parity flip rate in slip must converge to |Δ|/π.

## Assumptions

- Coupling λG is below the locking threshold.
- Detuning Δ is constant.
- Phase advances monotonically (no transient capture/release).
